# Lorelai_Lyons_ERS

Welcome to the truly official repository for Lorelai's first Revature project!

In this project I will be creating a system that allows employees to submit reimbursement tickets to their managers.

The system will store basic necessary information about employees and managers for access and organization purposes including:

    -Employee name, ID Number, and role, as well as login credentials including their username and password.
    -The program will also store information about currently processing and previously submitted tickets that will be accessible by relevant parties.

Managers will be able to view the tickets, and have the ability to subsequently approve or deny said submissions.

While managers will possess the ability to view *all* current and previously submitted tickets of their direct employees, 
said employees will be able to view both currently in process tickets, as well as previously submitted tickets.

The program will accomplish these tasks through the use of a combination of all the technologies we are currently learning including:
    -C#, Azure, Angular, SQL, and more.
